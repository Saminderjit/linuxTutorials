first bootloader partition is found by the kernel
then kernel image and RAM initialization process it loaded
then kernel pulls initial drivers and set up tools from RAM disk
then kernel hands the control of system over to /sbin/init  (CENTOS logs say 'INIT: version 2.86 booting')
then init performs some system maintenance tasks from /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit (/etc/inittab files runlevels info)
then after init has read the initdefault line  in /etc/inittabl and is entering runlevel3  (logs INIT: Entering runlevel: 3)
then init starts up the scripts located under that runlevel directory (startup processes basically)
Finally after this step, system should be ready to use. (It asks for user login info)
