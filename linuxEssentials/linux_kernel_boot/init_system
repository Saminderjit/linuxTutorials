After kernel loads up, it brings in the initalization RAM disk it then seeks out initialization system to handover control of the computer

First place to look up for /sbin/init, once kernel founds this process located. Then init process reads the configs from /etc/inittab 

Runlevel are defined under /etc/inittab and init process takes that information to start process initialization accordingly.

Run level:
0    Halt/ShutDown system
1    single user mode(root user is the only user allowed to login to the system, this level is mainly used for maintenance and repair tasks)
2    Multi-user mode (Without any networking i.e no interface nor any remote file systems mounted)
3    Multi-user mode (With networking enabled, most linux machines use this run level by default)
4    unused (only available to setup custom environments)
5    same as run level3 with GUI available
6    reboot  (init stops services and restarts the system)

MORE INFO: man runlevel

CENTOS: /etc/rc.d contains run-level directories which are used to startup the processes defined for that runlevel in order. NOTE that rc.d runlevel dirs contatin syslinks to the acutal start up scripts which are usually located under /etc/init.d
