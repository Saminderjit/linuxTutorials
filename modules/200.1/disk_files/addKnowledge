FD(filedescriptors): In simple words, when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry to represent that file and store the information about that opened file. So if there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in OS (somewhere in kernel). These entries are represented by integers like (...100, 101, 102....). This entry number is the file descriptor. So it is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in operating system. If your process opens 10 files then your Process table will have 10 entries for file descriptors.

lsof -u root | head -10  output has DEVICE 202, 64 which can be searched in the available devices directory by doing wildcard search in device directory like   ls -l /dev | grep '202, *' and then match that device in 'df -h' output   

lsof | head -10           --> will give information about top 10 files opened with addinfo like FileDescriptor(FD)  USER PID etc

lsof -u root     -->   will list only user root specific files

lsof | wc -l           --     to see how many files in total are open in the system including virtual
