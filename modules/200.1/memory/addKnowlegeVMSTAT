look for manpage vmstat to get more info for each field; for ex inactive means memory is allocated but not currently used i.e memory buffered but not currently used by paging (this block of memory movement is not reported by paging)

vmstat -a      -     to get more info for active and inactive memory out of memory used

we can use combination of free and vmstat commands to get more system knowledge

vmstat 5     -  means output system memory info after every 5 seconds to monitor memeory movements by processes

vmstat 6 -t     ---    means dumping memory stats with a timestamp  (can be used by monitoring tool or consul etc or feed this in database or script with timestamp info)

vmstat -s     --  to get knowlegde in pure english 


If an application calls a page and it is in the RAM, then it is a page in occurs. If an app calls for a page from memory, and that page is currently stored on the hard disk and has to be read back into the RAM, then a Page Out occurs.

If page-outs exceed page-ins, you definitely don't have enough RAM. Ideally, page-outs should be less than 20% of the number of page-ins (the fewer page-outs, the faster your machine is performing) On my machine, I aim for less than 5%.

Adding more RAM, or reducing the number of open applications, are the only ways to reduce page-outs. While freeing up memory by working with fewer and smaller files and apps may help, more RAM is the only reasaonable solution.
